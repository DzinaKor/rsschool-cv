### **About me**
---
I have always been fascinated by the power of technology to connect people and solve complex problems. As I have pursued my studies in computer science and gained practical experience building websites and applications. 

I have developed a strong passion for programming and the potential it holds to improve our lives and make a positive impact on the world. I'm eager to continue learning and growing in this field. My previous work experience as a manager improve my ability to think critically and creatively, make help me not afraid of difficulties and manage them and improve my communication skills. So I believe that all this combined with my enthusiasm for technology makes me well-suited for a career in IT.

I'm excited to be a part of the amazing process of shaping the future through technology and to contribute my skills and knowledge to this rapidly-evolving field
